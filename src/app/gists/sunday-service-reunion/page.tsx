                Little did she know this one picture would bring so much happiness to our DLSO family around the world!
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">It All Started with a Simple Picture</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">Sister Katherine Kenny went to church on Sunday and took a photo with some sisters. She shared it on WhatsApp with the caption &ldquo;For those who have forgotten my face.&rdquo;</p>
            <p className="mb-10">Little did she know this one picture would bring so much happiness to our DLSO family around the world!</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">&ldquo;I Know That Face!&rdquo;</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">The moment people saw the photo, the messages started flying:</p>
            <p className="mb-6"><strong>Dr. Mojisola Hosu</strong> was the first to respond: <em>&ldquo;It is good to be home. I recognize the first sister by the left but can not remember her name. It has been ages. üòä I also see Sister Fehintoluwa, 2nd from the right.&rdquo;</em></p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">Then everyone joined in with excitement:</p>
            <ul className="mb-10 space-y-3 pl-6">
              <li><em>&ldquo;Jeeeeeesuus! Where was I when this took place ooo üòÉüòÉ&rdquo;</em></li>
              <li><em>&ldquo;You were busy singing üòÇ&rdquo;</em></li>
              <li><em>&ldquo;Wow! Aunty Kehinde, Mummy JokeüòÇ, I know two other people there but can&apos;t remember their names.&rdquo;</em></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">The Joy of Recognition</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">What made everyone happy was seeing familiar faces after so many years. Some people were in Lagos, others in Akure, some even abroad - but when they saw this photo, it felt like home.</p>
            <p className="mb-10"><strong>Sister Taye</strong> from L.A church in Ondo was so excited: <em>&ldquo;Haa egi kehinde mi, my DLSO leader... sis Taye nike abolaji is greeting ooo, a big welcome ma, i can still recognize you well ma.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Beautiful Traditional Dresses</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">The sisters looked absolutely stunning in their traditional outfits - colorful gele (head wraps), beautiful fabrics, and bright smiles. One person joked: <em>&ldquo;All those beautiful dresses don&apos;t let our DLSO sisters take all o! üòÇ&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p className="mb-10">Everyone was impressed by how elegant they looked.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">&ldquo;Come and Visit!&rdquo;</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">The love didn&apos;t stop at just seeing faces. People immediately started making plans:</p>
            <ul className="mb-10 space-y-3 pl-6">
              <li><em>&ldquo;Please Akure isn&apos;t far, see your aburo before leaving both physically and financially&rdquo;</em></li>
              <li><em>&ldquo;I will private chat you about my coming to Akure if you will be around to check on you ma&rdquo;</em></li>
              <li><em>&ldquo;Aburo mi ti o bad! üòä&rdquo;</em> (My good sister!)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Laughing About Getting Older</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">There were funny moments too. When someone said they couldn&apos;t recognize people easily anymore, they joked: <em>&ldquo;It&apos;s either I&apos;m olding or olding is doing me, me I kuku could barely recognize anyone here üòÇ&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p className="mb-10">Everyone found this hilarious because we all feel the same way sometimes!</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Why This Matters</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">This simple WhatsApp conversation shows something beautiful about our DLSO family:</p>
            
            <div className="mb-10 space-y-4">
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>We Never Forget Each Other</strong> - Even after years apart, we still recognize and love each other.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>We&apos;re Always Ready to Help</strong> - The moment someone needed something, others offered help.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>We Celebrate Together</strong> - Everyone was genuinely happy to see familiar faces looking good and doing well.</p>
              <p className="mb-6"><strong>Distance Doesn&apos;t Matter</strong> - Whether you&apos;re in Lagos, Akure, or anywhere else in the world, you&apos;re still family.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">The DLSO Spirit Lives On</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">As Sister Jumoke perfectly said: <em>&ldquo;Though we All being separated, at distances all over the globe, yet fellowshiping in the spirit on this platform, we will fulfill our purposes wherever we are IJN.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p className="mb-10">This is what DLSO taught us - to love, support, and stay connected no matter where life takes us.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">What&apos;s Next?</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">This story shows we need more of these moments! If you have photos from recent church services, family gatherings, or just hanging out with DLSO family, share them with us.</p>
